# Load Testing Plan for ECS Services

## Overview
This document outlines the load testing strategy for the ECS services of the entertainment supply chain Generative AI chatbot. The goal is to ensure that the system can handle expected user loads while maintaining performance and reliability.

## Objectives
- Validate the performance of the chatbot under various load conditions.
- Identify bottlenecks in the system.
- Ensure that the system meets the defined service level agreements (SLAs) for response times and throughput.

## Load Testing Strategy
1. **Test Environment Setup**
   - Use a staging environment that mirrors the production setup.
   - Ensure all services (ECS, RDS, S3, etc.) are deployed and configured similarly to production.

2. **Load Testing Tools**
   - Utilize tools such as Apache JMeter, Locust, or Gatling for simulating user traffic.
   - Configure the tools to generate requests to the chatbot API endpoints.

3. **Test Scenarios**
   - **Baseline Test**: Measure the performance of the system under normal load conditions (e.g., 100 concurrent users).
   - **Stress Test**: Gradually increase the load to identify the maximum capacity of the system (e.g., up to 1000 concurrent users).
   - **Spike Test**: Sudden increase in load to simulate traffic spikes (e.g., 500 users in a short time).
   - **Endurance Test**: Run the system under a moderate load for an extended period (e.g., 24 hours) to identify memory leaks or performance degradation.

4. **Performance Metrics**
   - Response time (average, median, 95th percentile).
   - Throughput (requests per second).
   - Error rates (percentage of failed requests).
   - Resource utilization (CPU, memory, network I/O).

5. **Monitoring**
   - Set up CloudWatch metrics and alarms to monitor the performance of ECS services during testing.
   - Log performance data for analysis post-testing.

6. **Reporting**
   - Document the results of each test scenario, including performance metrics and any issues encountered.
   - Provide recommendations for optimization based on test findings.

## Conclusion
This load testing plan aims to ensure that the ECS services of the Generative AI chatbot can handle expected and unexpected loads effectively. Regular load testing should be integrated into the development lifecycle to maintain performance standards as the system evolves.
