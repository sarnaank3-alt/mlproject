# RDS Failover Runbook

## Overview
This document outlines the procedures to follow in the event of an RDS (Relational Database Service) failover. It is crucial to ensure minimal disruption to the chatbot services and maintain data integrity.

## Failover Scenarios
1. **Automatic Failover**: RDS instances in a Multi-AZ deployment automatically failover to the standby instance in case of an outage.
2. **Manual Failover**: Initiated by an administrator for maintenance or testing purposes.

## Procedures

### Automatic Failover
1. **Monitoring**: Ensure that CloudWatch alarms for RDS failover events are configured and actively monitored.
2. **Notification**: Upon failover, notifications should be sent to the operations team via configured SNS topics.
3. **Validation**: 
   - Check the application logs for any errors or warnings related to database connectivity.
   - Validate that the application is functioning correctly post-failover.

### Manual Failover
1. **Initiate Failover**:
   - Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to initiate a manual failover.
   - Command: 
     ```
     aws rds failover-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <your-db-instance-identifier>
     ```
2. **Monitor the Process**: 
   - Watch the RDS instance status in the AWS console.
   - Ensure that the failover completes successfully and the instance status changes to "available".

3. **Post-Failover Checks**:
   - Confirm that the application can connect to the new primary instance.
   - Run a series of tests to ensure that all functionalities are operational.
   - Check for any discrepancies in data or performance issues.

### Data Recovery
- In case of data loss during failover, utilize the latest S3 snapshots to restore the database.
- Follow the restoration process outlined in the RDS documentation to ensure data integrity.

### Communication
- Keep stakeholders informed throughout the failover process.
- Document any issues encountered and resolutions applied for future reference.

## Conclusion
Regularly review and test the failover procedures to ensure readiness in case of an actual event. Update this runbook as necessary to reflect changes in the architecture or operational procedures.
